# Why Your Site May Not Appear on Google Search

## 1. **Site Not Indexed Yet**
- New sites can take days or weeks to appear in Google.
- **Solution:** Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about), add your site, and submit your sitemap or request indexing for your homepage.

## 2. **No Sitemap or robots.txt**
- Google uses sitemaps to discover pages.
- **Solution:** Add `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` to your public folder. Example robots.txt:
  ```
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  Sitemap: https://bluvia.tech/sitemap.xml
  ```

## 3. **Noindex Meta Tag**
- If you have `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` or similar, Google will not index your site.
- **Solution:** Make sure your `<meta name="robots" content="index,follow">` is present (which you already have).

## 4. **Site Is Not Linked Anywhere**
- If no other site links to yours, Google may not discover it.
- **Solution:** Share your site on social media, directories, or get a few backlinks.

## 5. **Blocked by robots.txt**
- If your robots.txt blocks `/`, Google will not crawl your site.
- **Solution:** Ensure `Disallow: /` is NOT present.

## 6. **Domain Not Live or DNS Issues**
- If your domain is not properly set up or is down, Google can't crawl it.
- **Solution:** Check your domain and SSL with [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).

## 7. **Slow or Erroring Site**
- If your site is slow or returns errors, Google may skip it.
- **Solution:** Check your site with [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) and fix errors.

## 8. **Not Enough Content**
- Thin or duplicate content may not be indexed.
- **Solution:** Add more unique, high-quality content.

## 9. **No Backlinks**
- Sites with no links from other sites are less likely to be indexed quickly.
- **Solution:** Get a few backlinks.

## **How to Check If Indexed**
- Google: `site:bluvia.tech` (replace with your domain). If no results, your site is not indexed.

## **What To Do**
1. Add your site to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).
2. Submit your sitemap.
3. Request indexing for your homepage.
4. Wait a few days and check again.

**Tip:** Use Google Search Console for all indexing, crawling, and SEO issues.

# Using Vercel `.vercel.app` Subdomain for Google Search Console

You **can** use your Vercel `.vercel.app` URL (e.g. `https://bluvia.vercel.app/`) for Google Search Console, but:

- You **cannot** use DNS verification (TXT record) because you do not control DNS for `vercel.app`.
- You **must** use the **URL prefix property** in Google Search Console.

## Steps:

1. **Go to Google Search Console** and choose "URL prefix" property.
2. Enter your full site URL: `https://bluvia.vercel.app/`
3. Choose one of these verification methods:
   - **HTML file:** (Recommended) Place the provided HTML file in your `/public` folder. You already did this.
   - **Meta tag:** Add the provided `<meta name="google-site-verification" ...>` to your `<head>` in `layout.js`.
   - **Google Analytics** or **Tag Manager**: Only if you use them.

4. Click "Verify" in Search Console.

## Notes:

- You do **not** need to add a DNS TXT record for `.vercel.app` subdomains.
- Your `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` should use the `.vercel.app` base URL.
- You can use your site and get indexed by Google with the `.vercel.app` domain.

---

**Summary:**  
You can use your Vercel subdomain for Google Search Console and SEO. Use the HTML file or meta tag verification, not DNS.
